This is my cool notepad where I can think about how 6*7= and one beer is $6 but $6*12=

I can think about the basics of computers like:
2^4= and 2^8= and 2^16= and 2^32=

and if I want to get back to the original number then I can
/(2^16)=

but now the numbers are getting long
2^64=
2^128=

But if you think about things strangely then you might do (2^128)/(2^64)=

And if you really want to piss people off you might:
5/0= or something silly like ((5+7)-9= or like 2+(5=
