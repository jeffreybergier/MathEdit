# \[Not\] Soulver for OpenStep 4.2
A rudimentary calculator inspired by [Soulver](https://github.com/soulverteam) written in ancient Objective C that compiles and runs in OpenStep 4.2. The calculator logic also compiles and runs properly in Xcode 16. I guess that says a lot about the stability of Objective C and Foundation over the years.
